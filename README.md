# Coding Quiz


A coding quiz that will help you review and remember the basics.  
- We were given the starter code, but the quiz itself was not functional.
-I was given a series of acceptance criteria to make the quiz work for the user.

When you open the quiz in the browser, you may begin by clicking the "start quiz"
-button. Make sure you answer correctly! If you don't you will lose 15 seconds from your time.
-answer correctly, and your final score will be equal to the amount of time you have left.

When the quiz is over, you will enter your initials and your score will be kept in
-the "High Scores" table.

You may clear the scores using "clear high scores" and return to the quiz by clicking 
-"go back."


 
I learned a lot from this challenge, including how to create a working timer. How to 
-stop that timer. How to store the end value. how to refernce multipe sources for 
-the audio, and moving from different HTML files.(probably even more!)
